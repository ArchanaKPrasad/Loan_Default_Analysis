All business including the business of banking requires top line growth in terms of volumes of business to increase the bottom line of profit growth. Loan Default is the possibility of a loss resulting from a borrower's failure to repay a loan or meet contractual obligations. Loan Default also describes the risk that a bond issuer may fail to make payment when requested or that an insurance company will be unable to pay a claim. Thus, Loan default is always the threat to any financial institution and should be predicted in advance based on various features of the applicant.
